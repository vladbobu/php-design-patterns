# Builder Design Pattern

## Description

The Builder Pattern is used to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. This allows the same construction process to create different types of objects.

## Implementation

The example demonstrates the Builder Pattern using a `CarBuilder` interface and a `SportsCarBuilder` concrete class. The `CarDirector` class takes a builder object and uses it to construct a car. This pattern allows for creating complex objects step by step. The client can control the construction process by specifying different builders.

## Usage

- Ideal when creating complex objects that require numerous steps in their creation process.
- Useful when the construction process of a product should be independent of its components and their assembly.
- Beneficial when you want to construct objects with different representations using the same construction code.

Refer to the PHP code for a detailed implementation.
