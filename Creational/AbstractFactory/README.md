# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Description

The Abstract Factory Pattern in PHP is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows a system to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.

## PHP Implementation

In this example, `FurnitureFactory` is the abstract factory interface with methods `createChair` and `createSofa`. `ModernFurnitureFactory` and `VictorianFurnitureFactory` are concrete factories that create related family objects (`ModernChair`, `ModernSofa`, `VictorianChair`, `VictorianSofa`). The product interfaces (`Chair`, `Sofa`) define the products to be created. The pattern allows for the creation of products that follow a common theme, without specifying their concrete classes.

## Usage

- When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- When a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
- When you want to provide a class library of products, and you only want to reveal their interfaces, not their implementations.

Refer to the provided PHP code for a detailed implementation.
