# Prototype Design Pattern

## Description

The Prototype Pattern is used to create duplicate objects while keeping performance in mind. This pattern allows copying existing objects instead of creating new ones through standard methods, like constructors, which can be resource-intensive.

## Implementation

The example demonstrates the Prototype Pattern with a `ConcretePrototype` class that implements the `Prototype` interface. The `clone` method is used to create a duplicate of the object. This approach is especially useful when the cost of creating an object is more significant than copying an existing one.

## Usage

- Beneficial when the cost of creating an object is more significant than copying an existing one.
- Useful when an object is required that is similar to an existing object or when the creation process is more efficient through cloning.

Refer to the PHP code for a practical implementation.
