# Singleton Design Pattern

## Description

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Implementation

The example demonstrates the Singleton Pattern with a `Singleton` class. The class uses a private constructor, a private clone method, and a private wakeup method to prevent multiple instances. The `getInstance` static method ensures that only one instance of the Singleton class is created and returned.

## Usage

- Appropriate when a single instance of a class is needed to control the action throughout the execution.
- Useful for managing shared resources, such as database connections or file managers.
- Commonly used in logging, caching, thread pools, and configuration settings.

Refer to the PHP code for a practical implementation.
