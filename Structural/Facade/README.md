# Facade Design Pattern

## Description

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying the complex subsystem for the client. It offers a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Implementation

This example demonstrates the Facade Pattern using `SubsystemOne` and `SubsystemTwo` as parts of the complex subsystem. The `Facade` class simplifies interactions with these subsystems by providing a simplified method `operation`. The client interacts with the subsystems through the Facade, avoiding the need to interact with each subsystem directly.

## Usage

- Useful when you need a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
- Applicable when you want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level.
- Beneficial in reducing dependencies between clients and the complex subsystem.

Refer to the PHP code for a detailed implementation.
