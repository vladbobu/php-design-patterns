# Adapter Design Pattern

## Description

The Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It's often used to integrate new features or components into existing systems by matching interfaces without reworking the original code.

## Implementation

This example demonstrates the Adapter Pattern in a media player scenario. The `MediaPlayer` interface is the target interface, and `AdvancedMediaPlayer` is the adaptee interface. `VlcPlayer` and `Mp4Player` are concrete adaptees, while `MediaAdapter` acts as an adapter. The `AudioPlayer` class, acting as a client, can play various formats using the adapter.

## Usage

- Ideal for integrating new functionalities into existing systems without modifying the existing code.
- Useful when wanting to use an existing class but its interface is not compatible with the rest of your code.
- Applicable for creating reusable code that communicates with classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.

Refer to the PHP code for a detailed implementation.
