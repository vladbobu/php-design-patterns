# Template Method Design Pattern

## Description

The Template Method Pattern in PHP is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its overall structure.

## PHP Implementation

In this PHP example, `MealPreparation` is an abstract class that outlines the steps for preparing a meal with a `prepareMeal` template method. Concrete classes like `PastaMeal` and `SaladMeal` implement these steps in different ways. The template method enforces the sequence of steps, while allowing flexibility in how individual steps are carried out.

## Usage

- When you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.
- When you have several classes that contain almost identical code with only minor differences. Using the template method, you can move this common code into a base class.

Refer to the provided PHP code for a detailed implementation.
