# Observer Design Pattern

## Description

The Observer Pattern in PHP is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects. It allows an object, known as the subject, to notify other objects, known as observers, of any state changes.

## PHP Implementation

In this example, `NewsPublisher` (Concrete Observable) maintains a list of subscribers (Observers) and notifies them of news updates. `NewsSubscriber` (Concrete Observer) implements the Observer interface and defines how to receive and handle these updates. 

## Usage

- Implementing a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing.
- When a change to one object requires changing others, and the number of objects to change is unknown or dynamic.

Refer to the provided PHP code for a practical implementation.
