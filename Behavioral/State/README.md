# State Design Pattern

## Description

The State Pattern in PHP is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is used to simulate the behavior of complex objects that need to change their behavior based on their internal state.

## PHP Implementation

In this example, the `Context` class changes its behavior based on its internal `State`. The `StartState` and `StopState` classes implement the `State` interface, each providing specific behavior. Upon changing states, `Context` exhibits different behavior without altering its structure. 

## Usage

- When an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must be able to change its behavior at runtime based on internal changes.
- When complex conditions tie object behavior to its state, and you want to avoid having many conditional statements in an object's operations.

Refer to the provided PHP code for a detailed implementation.
